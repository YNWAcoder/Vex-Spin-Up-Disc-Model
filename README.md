# Vex-Spin-Up-Disc-Model
This is a code adopted from a paper published by V. R. Morrison (https://web.mit.edu/womens-ult/www/smite/frisbee_physics.pdf) to model the flight of a disc for the Vex Robotics Game: Spin Up

This code was taken from the paper mentioned above. It was then modified by me. However, I had lots of help from those on the vex forum (https://www.vexforum.com/t/spin-up-kinematics-graphing-tool/102551/58) and I could not have made this without them. 

IMPORTANT NOTE: 
As of now, the lift and drag coefficients are the same as the ones published in the paper. These could be different for the foam disks used in Spin Up. Therefore, take this model with a grain of salt.
